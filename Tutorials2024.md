## Tutorial 1: My first accelerator, a FODO cell

The main goal of this tutorial is to learn how to define a simple magnetic lattice and compute the linear optics functions using MAD-X. For that, we are going to define a FODO lattice, which is the simplest configuration we can design to get a net focusing effect of the beam in both transverse planes.

Questions:
    
1.    Define a FODO lattice with:
- the length of the cell, Lcell = 100 m
