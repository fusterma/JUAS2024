## Tutorial 1: My first accelerator, a FODO cell

The main goal of this tutorial is to learn how to define a simple magnetic lattice and compute the linear optics functions using MAD-X. For that, we are going to define a FODO lattice, which is the simplest configuration we can design to get a net focusing effect of the beam in both transverse planes.

Questions:
    
1.    Define a FODO lattice with:

      - the length of the cell, $L_{cell}$ = 100 m,
      - two quadrupoles, one focusing (FQ) and another one defocusing (DQ), of 5 m long ($L_{q}$),
      - the start of the sequence placed at the start of the first quadrupole,
      - the quadrupole focal length f = 200 m. HINT: K1 x $L_{q}$= 1/f.
